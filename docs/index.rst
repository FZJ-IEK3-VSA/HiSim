Welcome to ETHOS.HiSim's documentation!
==========================================================

`ETHOS.HiSim` is an open-source Python-package for simulation in building energy systems, and has been under continuous development as part of the project PiegStrom. `ETHOS.HiSim` contains a time step simulation engine and an extendable framework for integration. The `HiSim` includes multiple components that as discrete elements define together the entire of a designed building energy system. Some of the current included components are Building, PV-System, Battery, Seasonal Hydrogen Storage, Gas Heater, Weather and Occupancy Load Profiles (See :numref:`scheme`)

   HiSim Scheme

The goal of this package to enable a free fast to implement investigation of different building energy system strategies considering the many load profiles, physical conditions and alternative components from fossil fuel sources. The user can also design their own components to be implemented in its own building energy system.

Please, check the :ref:`installation` procedures to install `ETHOS.HiSim` in your local machine.

   Forschungszentrum Jülich IEK-3 Team

We are the `Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3) <https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/DE/Home/home_node.html>`_ belonging to the `Forschungszentrum Jülich <https://www.fz-juelich.de>`_. Our interdisciplinary institute's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
