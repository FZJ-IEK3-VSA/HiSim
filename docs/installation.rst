python -m venv hisimvenv
``

After its creation, the virtual environment can be activated in the same directory:
``python
hisimvenv\Scripts\activate
``
For Linux/Mac users, the virtual environment is set up and activated as follows:

``python
virtual hisimvenv
source hisimvenv/bin/activate
``
Alternatively, Anaconda can be used to set up and activate the virtual environment:
``python
conda create -n hisimvenv python=3.8
conda activate hisimvenv
``
With the successful activation, `ETHOS.Hisim` is ready to be locally installed.

Install Package
------------------------
After setting up the virtual environment, install the package to your local libraries:
