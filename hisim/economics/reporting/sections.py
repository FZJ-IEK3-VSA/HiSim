    The tabular form of the §5.4 audit trail: every applied award with what it is worth, how it
    is paid out (upfront grant, repayment grant, scheduled tax credit) and which uncertainty
    slots its cap bound in. The payout kind matters to a reviewer because it changes *when* the
    money lands and therefore its present value, and a cap that binds only in the HIGH slot
    explains an asymmetric band elsewhere in the report.

    Amounts come from `views.award_total_amount`, so a scheduled payout is shown as the sum of
    its instalments rather than as its zero upfront amount. Rows are de-duplicated by decision
    *content* (`_decisions_by_content`), not by measure name: perspectives that awarded a measure
    the same way share one row, named in the "Perspectives" column, while a perspective that
    decided differently gets its own rows. Returns empty when no award applied anywhere.

    """Section 5: the cumulation solver's audit trail, rendered.

    Answers "why did this measure get this much support, and what did it miss?" — which is the
    question a subsidy engine has to be able to answer to be trusted at all. Each measure gets a
    card listing what APPLIED (with the slots any cap bound in), what was REJECTED and the
    reason, and what is still OPEN because a required questionnaire field is unanswered, with
    the upper bound the open questions could still unlock. That last line is the actionable one
    for a user: it quantifies what answering the questionnaire is worth.

    One card per *distinct* decision, not per measure (`_decisions_by_content`): perspectives that
    decided a measure identically share a card and are named in its heading, and a perspective that
    decided differently — a different subsidy mode, a different installation context — gets a card
    of its own next to it. Before this the first perspective to mention a measure won and the rest
    were dropped without a trace, so the section was silently incomplete precisely on the measures
    whose support depends on the view taken.

    When no catalog ships for the run's country there are no decisions to show, and the section
    substitutes a note that the §10.1 legacy flat shim is doing the work instead — an audit trail
    requires a catalog. The section is omitted entirely only when there is neither a decision nor
    any support to draw.
