""" Enum classes to help against string constants.

Guidelines for enum classes:
    1. Write members names extensively, with no abbreviation, i.e., 'Watt' instead of 'W'.
    2. Attributes should follow the International System of Units (SI)
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units], i.e., for power the attribute is 'W'.
    3. Do not use multipliers such as 'Kilowatt'.
        3.1 Exceptions to this rule are: 'Kilometer', 'Kilogram'.
        3.2 In case of an exception, the simple form should be avoided altogether, e.g., given the 'Kilometer'
        is an Unit, then 'Meter' should not be used.
